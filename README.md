This project is about to code and desing the homepage of Google.

I will try to do my best to make see equal.

I'm going to code at the same time I practice html and css that i learn about 6 months ago.

Day 1: 
	I managed to place the navbar as I wanted.
	I put the logo of google too and the box-search like i want too.
	I could place the divs and the img as I wanted when before I did not know how.
	I search a lot in google but i learn a lot of doing this, is my angel guardian(?).
	
	Tomorrow im going to finish this if i can.
